# `@diez/generation`

This package deals with generating code for design systems based on its `CodegenDesignSystem`, a way of describing a design system which is compatible with the design primitives provided by `@diez/prefabs`.

In addition to code generation, it provides contextual utilities for dealing with design primitives like text styles and color.
