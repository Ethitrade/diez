# lorem-ipsum

This project was created with [Diez](https://beta.diez.org).

## What's in the box

The `src` directory contains source files for your Diez project. It is the living source of truth for your design system.

The `examples` directory contains example projects connected to your Diez project. Note that the example apps are only present for demonstration purposes, and can be safely removed.

## Quickstart

To quickly experience how Diez works, simply run `yarn demo`. This command will use Diez to compile a JavaScript SDK for your design system and link it to the example web project located in `examples/web`, then start the example web project in your browser.
