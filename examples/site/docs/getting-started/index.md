#### ðŸš¨ Early Beta Warning ðŸš¨

Although weâ€™re in early beta, we think you can get your first Diez project set up and powering a codebase in 5 minutes!

Please keep in mind that Diez is under active development. And there are a few notable pieces of functionality that will be dropping into the repo soon including:

*   CSS & Sass support
*   Wider Sketch support (currently only image syncing)
*   More guides and demos

<h3 id="set-up">Setting up your Diez project</h3>

<h4 id="intro">Introduction</h4>

Diez aims to make it easy for you to adopt a unified design language across codebases, platforms, and teams. It is intended to be used as _the_ source of truth for your design system.

#### Prerequisites
Install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/). Diez works best with Yarn, and our example projects use Yarn to run some scripts.

#### Scaffold out your Diez project
The best way to get up and running with Diez is by using our official template project which comes with everything set up and ready to party.

Run the following command in your terminal and follow the prompts. 

```bash
yarn create diez-project your-ds-name
```
<div class="note">In the above command, "<code class="inline">your-ds-name</code>" should be a name of your choosing. Please note that for the duration of the guides, your project will be referred to as <code class="inline">your-ds-name</code>.</div>

```bash
cd your-ds-name
```
That's it! You now have a Diez project set up and ready to power your apps.

### Next Steps

 We've written platform specifc guides for walking through this new Diez project you've just created. We recommend picking your flavor(s) and jumping right in. If you'd prefer to first learn a bit more about your Diez project and how to compose your design system, we've got you covered there too with the [Diez Basics guide](/getting-started/the-basics).
