# Diez &middot; [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/diez/diez.svg?token=YuETDnVqzQjQytETzD8J&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/diez/diez) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/diez/diez/branch/master/graph/badge.svg?token=pgB9U8YLUU)](https://codecov.io/gh/diez/diez)

Diez is a tool for creating highly scalable, cross-platform design systems. The core of Diez is a [framework](https://github.com/diez/diez/tree/master/src/framework) for composing design tokens in TypeScript, plus a [compiler](https://github.com/diez/diez/tree/master/src/compiler) (transpiler) that builds those tokens into pure-native SDKs for iOS, Android, and the Web.

This monorepo also includes:

 * [Design extractors](https://github.com/diez/diez/tree/master/src/extractors): Extract image assets and strongly typed style definitions from any Sketch, Figma, InVision DSM, or Adobe XD file
 * [Prefabs](https://github.com/diez/diez/tree/master/src/framework/prefabs): Pre-built, reusable components for common design system elements like Colors and Typography
 * A cross-platform [standard library](https://github.com/diez/diez/tree/master/src/framework/stdlib): iOS, Android, and Web native bindings for all the prefabs included with Diez
 * [Diez CLI](https://github.com/diez/diez/tree/master/src/cli): Generate, configure, and manage Diez projects
 * You can find all of the packages in the repo here. Feel free to take a look around!

## Target Platform Support

Diez can be extended to support any language, platform, or development environment. The [native bindings](https://diez:supersecure@beta.diez.org/glossary/#bindings) included with Diez support the following targets:

### iOS

The minimum deployment target for a generated iOS SDK is iOS 11.

### Android

The SDK generated by the provided Android implementation has been tested against Android Q (10).

### Web

In the provided web target implementation, we support CSS, Sass, and vanilla JS. Browser and build tooling support is very broad, and Diez web SDKs should work in any modern web browser.
